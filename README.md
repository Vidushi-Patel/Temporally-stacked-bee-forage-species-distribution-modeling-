# Temporally-stacked-bee-forage-species-distribution-modeling-

Migratory beekeeping decisions are driven by spatial-temporal availability of flowring forage species. Species distribution modelling (SDM) and stacked species distribution modelling (S-SDM)is widely used to predict the geographic distribution of species richness or assemblages. Here a method for stacking SDMs based on a temporal element, the flowering phenology of melliferous flora species is presented. Data presenting the SDM outputs for thirty key forage species used for honey production in Western Australia is available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2022.108783. Grids reflecting the diversity of flowering species per pixel were created by stacking the species distribution outputs based on the monthly flowering times of each species. This approach can be used for predicting temporal forage availability for a range of different fauna that rely on melliferous flora.
